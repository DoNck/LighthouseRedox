These files have been captured with Wireshark and USBPcap on Windows 10.

You can open them in Wireshark and then export to other formats using File->Export Packet Dissections.

Like everything in here this is not complete yet.

If you don't have Vive hardware yet but still want to test a certain scenario and look at the resulting USB trace, [create a new issue](https://github.com/nairol/LighthouseRedox/issues) and state as precisely as possible what you want me (or others) to test.
